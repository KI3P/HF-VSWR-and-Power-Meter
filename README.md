# HF-VSWR-and-Power-Meter

System that measures the VSWR and power level of transmitter signals in the HF bands (3.5 MHz to 30 MHz) with better than 5% accuracy for VSWRs below 3.0. For a detailed explanation of its operation, see [its project page](https://ko4thb.github.io/2023/12/23/vswr_and_power_meter.html).

Gerbers were generated for manufacture by JLCPCB.

Thanks to N7DDC for sharing the design of the [ATU-100 antenna tuner](https://github.com/Dfinitski/N7DDC-ATU-100-mini-and-extended-boards). And to W2AEW for his [excellent explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byF1FLdbUiA) of how a directional coupler works. IN3OTD has an [online calculator](https://www.qsl.net/in3otd/parallr.html) for synthesizing arbitrary resistor values from standard value.  All these were tremendously helpful as I designed this VSWR meter.
